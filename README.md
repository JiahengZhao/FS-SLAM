# FSSLAM

This repository is the code for paper **2D Laser SLAM with Closed Shape Features: Fourier Series Parameterization and Submap Joining** which is published on RA-L / ICRA 2021.

Author: Jiaheng Zhao, Tiancheng Li, Tong Yang, Liang Zhao, and Shoudong Huang

The simulated data is generated by [the code here](https://github.com/JiahengZhao/2Dlidar_simulation_fs).

## Language

* Matlab

## How to use

#### 1. Add to searching path / Remove searching path

Execute `startup` to add path before running.

Execute `clearfolder` to remove path.

#### 2. Test FS-SLAM

Run `fsSLAM` to run submap joining.

#### 3. Test Submap Joining

Run `fsSLAMJoining` to run submap joining.
